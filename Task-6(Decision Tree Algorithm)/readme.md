Hello viewers, this is my second task as an intern in the Sparks Foundation.The task was to create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.
The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
I've used the Decision Tree Classifier model for the prediction and I hope you understand the code well. You can get the dataset here - https://bit.ly/3kXTdox
